# avralarm

I have an teensy++ attached to a custom board for various I/O.  This is the software
for a very basic alarm system using the board I/O (sensors, alarm relay, etc).  The
system communicates with the outside world via the teensy++ usb port.

Initial commit is just the sensing.  Real logic/state to come later.
